This is StegoTorus, a framework for implementing steganographic
transports for the Tor anonymity overlay.  For a detailed description
of the design, please see
<http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/ccs2012-stegotorus.pdf>.  It
requires OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later and Libevent 2.0 or later.

This software is INCOMPLETE and UNSAFE TO USE OUTSIDE A LABORATORY,
and is unlikely to receive further development.  We hope that leaving
the source available will be of use to someone, but it will not even
compile without modifications.

If you have an immediate need for a steganographic transport that
works in the field, Tails <https://tails.boum.org/> has experimental
support for obfsproxy: <https://tails.boum.org/todo/obfsproxy/>

If you are interested in continuing development of StegoTorus or
something similar, please contact the Tor Project at
<tor-dev@lists.torproject.org>.
