This doesn't work yet.

It requires OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later. (I would require 0.9.8, but that would
break OSX 10.5.)

It requires Libevent 2.0 or later.

See doc/protocol-spec.txt for the protocol design.  It is based on brl's
obfuscated openssh protocol.

See doc/TODO for open tasks.

This project might get renamed to "twobfuscate", depending.

Happy hacking!
