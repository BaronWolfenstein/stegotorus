Chop functions explained:

chop circuit senders demistified.
chop_circuit::

   send(): 
    - call send_all_steg_data to send all steg data
    - if data is available finds a connection of approperiate size and send data
    - elif no data available it retransmit from transmit queue
    - elif nothing on transmit queue sends random block

   send_targeted(chop_conn_t):
    - I don't know who calls this function.
    - check if the steg protocol data available send_targeted_steg_data(conn, size)
    - elif data available call send_targeted
    - elif no data then retransmit from the queue using send_targeted(conn, size)

   send_targeted(chop_conn_t, size)
    - attach either op_DAT or op_FIN to the block calls send_targeted(conn, size, opcode,payload)
   
   send_targeted(conn, size, opcode, payload):
    - actually put stuff together and gives them to transmit queue.

   send_special(opcode_t f, struct evbuffer *payload)
