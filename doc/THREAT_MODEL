obfs2 was created to work on top of the Tor protocol (and specifically
it's TLS handshake phase). Do not use obfs2 to obfuscate other
protocols, unless you are super-sure of what you are doing.

A list follows, of known attacks that obfs2 protects or does not
protect against. obfs2 does not protect you against unknown attacks.

Attacks obfs2 protects against:
* Non-intelligent DPI boxes censoring based on TLS content patterns.
* In the case of a shared secret, it also protects against intelligent DPI boxes.

Attacks obfs2 does not protect against:
* Any distinguisher based on the Tor protocol. This includes timing, packet
  size and replay attacks.
* Any distinguisher based on packet entropy.
* In the case of obfs2 without a shared secret, obfs2 does not protect
  against an intelligent DPI box; a DPI box that simply deobfuscates
  the obfs2 protocol (for those not familiar with the protocol: this
  is quite easy.).
