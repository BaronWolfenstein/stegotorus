Immediate priority:

  - circuit_t::downstream belongs to the protocol
  - upstream connection does not have to trigger downstream connection
  - downstream can be disconnected and connected many times (for HTTP steg)
  - implement a demo 1:N protocol

Protocol design:

  - Get more eyes on obfs2
  - Design + code a serious 1:N protocol with crypto and optional steg

Cleanup:

  - automatic linkage of protocol and steg modules
  - real booleans
  - consistent use of [u]intN_t throughout

Testing:

  - break up the integration tests sensibly
  - more thorough integration tests
  - don't rely on timeouts so much in the integration tests

Misc:

  - make socks a protocol rather than a special case?

  - configuration is way too duplicated
    - split config/conn/circuit vtables?
    - genericize configuration?

  - Drop the openssl dependency (?)
  - Make it obey the xxx-pluggable-transport spec in Tor.
