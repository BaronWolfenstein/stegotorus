Immediate priority:

  - downstream can be disconnected and connected many times (for HTTP steg)
  - HTTP steg should honor query-response pattern
  - dsteg should cope with the client having nothing to say
    - implies: all steg modules must implement chaff
  - implement a demo 1:N protocol

Protocol design:

  - Get more eyes on obfs2
  - Design + code a serious 1:N protocol with crypto and optional steg

Cleanup:

  - real booleans
  - consistent use of [u]intN_t throughout

Testing:

  - more tl_* test patterns
  - better timeout handling in obfstestlib?

Misc:

  - make socks a protocol rather than a special case?

  - configuration is way too duplicated
    - split config/conn/circuit vtables?
    - genericize configuration?

  - Drop the openssl dependency (?)
  - Make it obey the xxx-pluggable-transport spec in Tor.
