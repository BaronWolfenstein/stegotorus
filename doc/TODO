Still to do:

  - Get more eyes on the protocol

Still to implement for minimal function:

  - Unit tests for all the crypto
    - aes-ctr
    - sha256
    - random number generator
  - Unit tests for the protocol functions
    - Try sender and receive, make sure they can handshake right and
      communicate
    - Make sure handshake still works if data arrives in a trickle
    - Make sure bogus handshake gets rejected
  - Client-side: Socks support
  - Server-side: connect to a local port
  - the main function

Later:

  - Drop the openssl dependency
  - some way to set a shared secret or two or three
  - Implement the xxx-pluggable-transport thing for Tor.
