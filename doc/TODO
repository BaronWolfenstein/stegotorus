Immediate priority:

  - Design + code a serious 1:N protocol with crypto and optional steg

  - Unit tests for x_rr
  - Redo x_rr with the same packet headers as the real chopper?
  - SOCKS support for x_rr (and the real chopper)

  - downstream can be disconnected and connected many times (for HTTP steg)
  - HTTP steg should honor query-response pattern

  - More steg modules

Protocol design:

  - Get more eyes on obfs2 and chopper crypto

Cleanup:

  - real booleans
  - consistent use of [u]intN_t throughout
  - do something about the size_t-to-unsigned long casts all over the place
  - obfsproxy / test_obfsproxy binary split
  - make socks a protocol or something,
    rather than a special case in the generic code

Testing:

  - more tl_* test patterns
  - better timeout handling in obfstestlib?
  - make the Python tests work on Windows

Misc:

  - configuration is way too duplicated
    - split config/conn/circuit vtables?
    - genericize configuration?

  - Drop the openssl dependency (?)
  - Make it obey the xxx-pluggable-transport spec in Tor.
