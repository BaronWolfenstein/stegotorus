Design issues:

  - Get more eyes on the protocol

Immediate priority:

  - conn_free'ing a downstream connection should not close the upstream
    (IN PROGRESS)
  - fix obfs2 end-to-end

Necessary for 1:N:

  - circuit_t::downstream belongs to the protocol
  - upstream connection does not necessarily trigger downstream connection
  - implement a demo 1:N protocol

Later:

  - implement a more serious 1:N protocol using crypto and steg

  - automatic linkage of protocol and steg modules
  - break up the integration tests sensibly

  - make socks a protocol rather than a special case?

  - configuration is way too duplicated
    - split config/conn/circuit vtables?
    - genericize configuration?

  - Drop the openssl dependency (?)
  - Make it obey the xxx-pluggable-transport spec in Tor.
