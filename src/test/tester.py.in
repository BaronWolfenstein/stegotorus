# Integration tests for obfsproxy.
#
# The obfsproxy binary is assumed to exist in the current working
# directory, and you need to have Python 2.6 or better (but not 3).
# You need to be able to make connections to arbitrary high-numbered
# TCP ports on the loopback interface (there is, however, an effort to
# figure out which ones are already in use) and all IPv4 addresses in
# 127.0.0/24 are assumed to be bound to the loopback interface.
